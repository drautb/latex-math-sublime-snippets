===========================

Sublime Text Snippets for creating LaTeX Mathematics expressions.

I designed these snippets to embed LaTeX Mathematics expressions in Markdown. 
I render them using [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/). To do the same, just insert
[this snippet](https://gist.github.com/drautb/6529252) at the top of your markdown file, 
and the browser will take care of the rendering.
